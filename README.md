# Audience_Rating_Prediction
This project aims to predict the audience rating of movies based on various features such as genre, previous audience ratings, and other relevant factors. The model is built using machine learning algorithms and is evaluated for its performance using common metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a predictive model that can forecast audience ratings based on historical data. This is done using machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
seaborn

Model
In this project, a Decision Tree model is used to predict audience ratings. The model is trained on historical data and is evaluated using a test set. The evaluation metrics include:

Accuracy score
Confusion matrix
Classification report
Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics give an understanding of how well the model is predicting the audience ratings.

Future Improvements
Implementing other machine learning algorithms like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting for better performance.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's accuracy.
Collecting more data to improve the modelâ€™s generalization capabilities.
